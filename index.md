## Haoyu Hu's Leading Projects

### 1. Machine Learning Reveals Hemispheric Differences in the Human Brain

      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Accapted by 2022 OHBM Annual Meeting</b></p>
      <p><b>I wrote the code and ran the model to explore brain structure asymmetry with HCP dataset</b></p>
      <p><b>High accuracy was got by SVM (Area: 99.6%, Thickness: 88.2%). By extracting and comparing the most important components to build the model, we found four brain regions contributed most: Pars orbitalis; Frontal pole; Rostral anterior cingulate; Transverse temporal</b></p>

### 2. Detached or Deleted: What Is the Strategy Working Memory Most Likely to Take to Outdated Items that Are Paid Attention to?
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
      <p><b>We designed a psychological paradigm to solve the problem the former research didn't save: for outdated information that has been paid attention to but will not be used in the following tasks, will it be blocked outside the working memory or will it enter the working memory and be deleted then?</b></p>
      <p><b>We use a combination of change awareness paradigm and visual search paradigm to explore the problem</b></p>

### In the end
Some projects are writing papers, and the code will be open source with the submission of the papers
